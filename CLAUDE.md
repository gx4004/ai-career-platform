# Career Workbench — Development Context

## What This Is
AI-powered job-search workspace. 6 tools (Resume Analyzer, Job Match, Cover Letter, Interview Q&A, Career Path, Portfolio Planner). Users upload resume once, use it across all tools. Currently in **thesis demo mode** — all results fully visible, no ad gate. Hybrid monetization (ad-gated results + premium tier) planned for post-thesis launch.

## Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TanStack Start/Router + Vite 7 + Tailwind 4 + Radix/shadcn + Framer Motion
- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Alembic + Railway Postgres
- **LLM**: Vertex AI Gemini 2.5 Flash (native async, single provider V1). Cheaper model for interview practice feedback.
- **Auth**: JWT in HttpOnly cookies (access 30min + refresh 7day) + Google OAuth (authlib) + password reset (Resend)
- **Deploy**: Full Railway (backend + frontend + Postgres). Same domain, path-based routing.
- **Monitoring**: Railway metrics + Sentry free tier
- **Package manager**: pnpm (not npm)

## Key Architecture Decisions
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| TanStack Start, not Next.js | Lighter opinions, better router DX |
| Heuristic blend scoring only Resume + Job Match | Generative tools can't produce meaningful heuristic scores |
| Single LLM provider (Gemini Flash) | No multi-provider abstraction needed V1 |
| BS4 + Playwright fallback for scraping | Best effort at JS sites, graceful paste fallback |
| SameSite=Lax cookies, no CSRF tokens | Sufficient for SPA + JSON API |
| Client-side ad unlock (sessionStorage) | Bypass risk accepted, pragmatic for V1 (currently bypassed for thesis demo) |
| English only V1 | Realistic scope for solo dev |
| In-memory cache V1 | Redis V1.1 when traffic warrants |
| 4 retry + exponential backoff for LLM | 5s→10s→20s→40s + jitter, 120s per-call timeout, then tool-specific fallback (heuristic for Resume / Job Match, explicit error for generative tools) |
| Admin panel integrated in main frontend | No separate app, /admin/* routes |

## Commands
```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend && pnpm dev                   # Dev server (port 3000)
cd frontend && pnpm test                  # Vitest (all tests)
cd frontend && pnpm test src/lib/tools    # Vitest (single file or pattern)
cd frontend && pnpm typecheck             # TypeScript check
cd frontend && pnpm build                 # Production build

# Backend
cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
cd backend && pytest                      # All tests
cd backend && pytest app/path/test_foo.py # Single test file
cd backend && alembic upgrade head        # Run migrations
```

## Code Conventions
- Tool order: Resume(1) → Job Match(2) → Career Path(3) → Cover Letter(4) → Interview Q&A(5) → Portfolio(6)
- Tool groups: `primary` (resume, job-match) | `application` (cover-letter, interview) | `planning` (career, portfolio)
- All tool metadata lives in `frontend/src/lib/tools/registry.ts`
- Zod schemas in `frontend/src/lib/api/schemas.ts` must mirror backend Pydantic schemas in `backend/app/schemas/`
- Every tool router endpoint calls `run_tool_pipeline()` — don't bypass it for new tools
- CSS architecture: no CSS modules, plain CSS files in `styles/` with BEM-ish naming
- Hybrid theme: dark sidebar/topbar + light content area. No dark mode toggle.
- Tool input pages: dark-to-light gradient hero (tool-input-hero) with per-tool animations + chips, form surface below
- Result pages: premium redesign with dark hero variant (Resume/Job Match), heroExtra sections, midSection (Fix First cards), per-tool views
- Deploy: push to both `main` and `deploy` branches (`git push origin main && git push origin main:deploy`). Railway watches `deploy`.
- Mobile: bottom tab bar (`MobileNav`) + tools sheet (`ToolGridSheet`); responsive CSS for the existing layouts. No bespoke mobile-only components beyond those.
- Re-generate always creates new ToolRun row (parent_run_id chain, never overwrite)
- Guest runs: in-memory Map only, never persisted, drives signup conversion
- Workflow context: sessionStorage, tab-scoped, no cross-tab sync

## Codex Integration (GPT-5.4)

### When to Use Codex
- **After every feature/fix**: Run `/codex:review --background` before creating PR
- **Complex bugs**: `/codex:rescue --background investigate <problem>` — second opinion from GPT-5.4
- **Critical changes (auth, security, data)**: `/codex:adversarial-review --background <focus>`
- **Design decisions**: `/codex:adversarial-review challenge whether <decision> was the right call`
- **Stuck on a bug**: `/codex:rescue --background fix <description>` — let Codex try while Claude continues

### Review Gate (ENABLED)
Review gate is ON — Codex automatically reviews Claude's output before completing. If issues found, Claude must address them first. This catches bugs early.
- Enable: `/codex:setup --enable-review-gate`
- Disable temporarily: `/codex:setup --disable-review-gate`
- Warning: drains usage faster — disable during rapid iteration, re-enable before PR

### Collaboration Patterns
- **Claude implements → Codex reviews**: Default workflow. Claude writes code, Codex validates.
- **Parallel investigation**: Claude works on Task A, Codex investigates Task B in background.
- **Codex → Claude handoff**: Codex finds issue via rescue, Claude implements the fix.
- **Dual review**: Both Claude (`/review`) and Codex (`/codex:review`) review before merge.

### Proactive Reminders
- Remind user "Want a Codex review on this?" after completing significant work
- Suggest `/codex:rescue` when debugging takes >2 attempts
- Suggest `/codex:adversarial-review` before any PR that touches auth, payments, or data models

### Config
- Model: GPT-5.4 (default, best quality). Use `--model gpt-5.4-mini` only for quick checks.
- Results: `/codex:status` for progress, `/codex:result` for output
- Resume in Codex: `codex resume <session-id>` to continue work directly in Codex CLI

## What NOT to Do
- Don't add i18n translations (EN only V1, infrastructure stays)
- Don't implement premium/subscription tier (V1.1)
- Don't add affiliate links (V1.1)
- Don't add CAPTCHA (V1.1, rate limit sufficient)
- Don't implement real AdSense SDK (placeholder until approved)
- Don't re-enable ad gate (thesis demo = fully free, AdGatedLock bypassed)
- Don't send welcome or account-deletion confirmation emails (V1.1; password-reset is the only transactional email V1)
- Don't add LLM streaming (v2)
- Don't create new documentation files unless asked
- Don't modify tool priority numbers without asking
- Always push to BOTH `main` and `deploy` branches for Railway deployment
